### Project: Waddle

Waddle is a simple, no-frills travel planning application catered to people who love doing everything on their keyboards.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add an export command.
  * What it does: This command allows users to export the itinerary they have planned into an offline PDF document.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as users usually travel with other people, hence
there is most likely a need to share itinerary with others. This feature allows users to have an offline PDF document
to send to their travel buddies.
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it involved incorporating external libraries to our project, and 
it was necessary to look through the heavy documentation to implement this feature.
  * Credits: This feature heavily relies on [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/)
  

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ciaoosuuu&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
