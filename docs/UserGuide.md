## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  - e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/My Japan Trip`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  - e.g. `n/NAME [c/COUNTRY]` can be used as `n/My Japan Trip c/Japan` or as `n/My Japan Trip`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  - e.g. `[w/WADDLERS]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `w/me`, `w/friend 1 w/friend 2` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  - e.g. if the command specifies `c/CATEGORY d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORY` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  - e.g. if you specify `d/Eat Ramen d/Aquarium`, only `d/Aquarium` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  - e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
