## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  - e.g. in `add d/DESCRIPTION ...`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add d/My Japan Trip`.
   
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  - e.g. `d/DESCRIPTION [c/COUNTRY] sd/START_DATE du/DURATION` can be used as `d/My Japan Trip c/Japan sd/2023-04-01 du/14` or as `d/My Japan Trip sd/2023-04-01 du/14`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  - e.g. if the command specifies `c/COUNTRY d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION c/COUNTRY` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  - e.g. if you specify `d/Eat Ramen d/Aquarium`, only `d/Aquarium` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  - e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
